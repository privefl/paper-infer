\section*{Code and data availability}

The UK Biobank data is available through a procedure described at \url{https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/using-the-resource/}. 
All code used for this paper is available at \url{https://github.com/privefl/paper-infer/tree/master/code}.
We have extensively used R packages bigstatsr and bigsnpr \cite[]{prive2017efficient} for analyzing large genetic data, packages from the future framework \cite[]{bengtsson2020unifying} for easy scheduling and parallelization of analyses on the HPC cluster, and packages from the tidyverse suite \cite[]{wickham2019welcome} for shaping and visualizing results.
The latest version of R package bigsnpr can be installed from GitHub, and a recent enough version can be installed from CRAN [TODO: VERIFY].
